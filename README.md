# Data Modeling
### Code sharing for Northwestern MS in Data Science program<br>
### MSDS 410 (Fall 2020)

The portfolio of projects in this repository cover the following:

* A2: Simple Linear Regression (SLR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models
* A7: Automated Variable Selection, Multicollinearity, and Predictive Modeling
* A8: Binary Classification with Logistic Regression
* A9: Modeling Count Data

**Course overview**<br>
This course focuses on traditional statistics and data modeling for supervised learning problems, as employed in observational and experinental research. With supervised learning there is a clear distinction between explanatory and response variables. The objective is to predict responses, whether they be quantitative as with multiple regression, or categorical as with logistic regression and multinomial logit models. Students work on research and programming assignments, exploring data, identifying appropriate models, and validating models. They utilize techniques for observational and experimental research design, data visualization, variable transformation, model diagnostics, and model selection. 

Learning outcomes include the ability to:

* Successfully apply three steps in statistical modeling of exploratory data analysis, model identification, and validation
* Use conceptual and theoretical foundations of Linear Regression and the General Linear Model to justify choices and actions in the data modeling process and in the interpretation of results
* Compare and contrast the conceptual and practical differences between statistical inference and predictive modeling
* Create programs and code using  R for data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and for fitting and validating statistical models
* Model non-linear relationships between variables using transformations, higher-order linear models, and models with interaction
* Use automated variable selection procedures as a tool for model identification in the presence of a large number of predictor variables, in addition to articulating procedure strengths and limitations
